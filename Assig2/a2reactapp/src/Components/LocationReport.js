                        Below are the 2 locations you selected and a brief summary on why the installation of MPDCs in these locations will prove beneficial.

                    <h4>Adelaide, Greenhill Road</h4>
                    <img src="https://www.mapquestapi.com/staticmap/v5/map?key=Es5yMrQayzVhmBoTsECtkSUg1DBbtyou&center=-34.9408333,138.6107222&zoom=16&size=600,400&locations=-34.9408333,138.6107222" alt="Map with Marker" />

                    <p>This location is situated near an intersection very near to Adelaide's CBD. What makes this a prime placement for a new MPDC is due to the high rates of drivers exceeding speed limits near this intersection as seen below.</p>

                    <br />

                    <h4>Norwood, Magill Road</h4>
                    <img src="https://www.mapquestapi.com/staticmap/v5/map?key=Es5yMrQayzVhmBoTsECtkSUg1DBbtyou&center=-34.9148889,138.639139&zoom=17&size=600,400&locations=-34.9148889,138.639139" alt="Map with Marker" />

                    <p>This location near the intersection where Magill Road intersects with Portrush Road is a high traffic area with decently high speeds to match. This is another locations where a number of drivers choose to exceed the speed limit by margins seen below.</p>
